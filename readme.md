### Data feeds: dAPIs
dAPIs provide smart contracts with access to continuously updated feeds of market data by oracles hosted by highly reputable financial data providers.

- Managed dAPIs are powered by multiple first-party oracles with native-chain aggregation offering a verifiable, decentralized oracle solution.
Once a dAPI has been integrated a smart contract can access a range of data feed services through the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org/dapis).

### OEV
Oracle Extractable Value

- The ability to allow users/searchers to bid for the right to update an price feed before the oracle is scheduled to update.
Learn more about OEV [Here](https://docs.api3.org/reference/oev-network/).
